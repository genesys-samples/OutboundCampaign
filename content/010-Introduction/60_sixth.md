## Scripting
Scripting is an important part of any outbound voice campaign. Genesys Cloud CX provides a native Scripting tool that allows Outbound Administrators the ability to craft the desktop presented to agents when handling an outbound call. The scripting tool can present information about the customer the agent is calling, provide a script to help guide the conversation and be a place where they can complete processes such as receiving payment.

How to create a script is not the focus of this workshop. Instead, we want you to understand how scripts are used as a vital part of outbound campaigns. If you do wish to learn more about creating a script, we have another workshop for you; "MeaningFul Interactions Part 1 - Agent Scripts." https://workshop.genesys.com/workshops/Architect_IVR_Data-Actions/ 

## Download & Import the Script 
For today's workshop, we have provided an already-created script that we've made for G Freight. [Click here](/downloadables/GFreight.script) to download it. 

Once you've downloaded the script to your machine, follow the steps outlined in this resource article to add it to your own Genesys Cloud CX instance. https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/import-scripts/
