## Schedules and Sequences
Contact Center Managers don't want to manually go and turn campaigns on and off. This is why Genesys Cloud CX offers Schedules and Sequences. 

Schedules, as the name suggests, allow you to specify the times that certain campaigns are running. For example, maybe you want to run a campaign that calls you VIP clients only during typical lunch hours and calls the other clients in the morning. 

Sequences, allow you to set a logical order to the campaigns that run. Similar to the last example, perhaps you want to call your VIP campaign first. You could have a sequence that says "First, run the VIP campaign. Once we've finished calling that contact list, start the General Client campaign."

Sequences also can get applied to a schedule. For example, you can say that we want to run a sequence of campaigns from 9 am to 5 pm every weekday.
