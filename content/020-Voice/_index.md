## Getting Started With Voice Campaigns

In this lesson, we will discuss the basics of getting started with building a voice campaign. Lets Take a look at our customer scenario once more:

G Freight continues to grow and scale its ability to provide an empathetic experience to customers and prospects through multiple channels, the first and primary channel they focus on is voice. Although they are well established in their ability to take inbound interactions, their outbound capabilities today are not optimally configured, automated, and take quite a bit of manual work. 

To begin, they know they need to design a process that automates the generated leads, taken from inbound requests on their website, and create prospective customer records that are then updated to a constantly running outbound campaign. Additionally, they want to ensure that numbers that have opted to not be contacted are not included or called within that campaign.

Once the voice campaign has been created, G Freight wants to take it a step further, automating and mapping when outbound calls are being placed by creating schedules for the campaign to run. 

For todays workshop we will focus on the base configuration of a voice campaign, leading into a future session of utilizing the power of APIs and automation to achieve everything G Freight needs in their business to help deliver value and empathy to their prospects

We see there are quite a few objectives this business has, before we get into automation lets take a look at this step by step:

1) Creating a list of prospects to call
2) create rules for our campaign
3) create our campaign
4) Schedule campaign
