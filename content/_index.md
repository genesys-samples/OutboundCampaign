# Outbound Campaigns with Genesys Cloud CX

## Welcome to our Outbound Campaign Workshop
Our customer, a Package & Freight delivery firm, is re-imagining the way they engage with their customers. The business, G Freight, already uses Genesys Cloud CX for inbound communications. Now they want to take a more proactive approach to the way they engage with the companies that they do business with. In this workshop, it'll be your job to help G Freight utilize the full breadth of Genesys Cloud CX's outbound suite to satisfy and exceed their needs. G Freight has broken its requirements out by media type and we will take a similar approach to our configuration as we go through the workshop. 

### Voice
G Freight uses the voice channel for sales outreaches. As a B2B company, these are typically high-impact calls where they call business executives of prospective customers. They also need automated list management fed from various sources and pre and post calls rules to help automate lists as they are running.

### SMS
G Freight wants to use SMS for freight delivery updates. For example, they want their businesses to be contacted for the estimated delivery time, delays and any other changes to their deliveries.

### Email
G Freight wants to utilize email campaigns for offering discounts to their customers during the holiday season. Black Friday is coming up, and G Freight wants to gather up more of their customer's shipping needs by offering Black Friday discounts to them.
