## Campaign Creation
Now that we've covered the building blocks, we are ready to talk about creating a campaign. If you are wondering why this is near the end of the introduction, it is because all of the other components that we just covered get applied to a campaign. In the image below, you see that we are defining everything that we've covered so far.

Referencing back to the image, we have selected Progressive as our dialing mode, applied our agent script and chosen a call analysis response to use to specify what happens when there is a live voice vs an answering machine. We also selected our contact list and applied a contact list filter and DNC list. We have a set of call rules applied too that will execute actions if certain conditions are met. Last but not least, you'll notice that we are using Automatic Time Zone Mapping because there is nothing selected for Contactable Time Sets.

One other important point is that we have a Queue assigned to this campaign. The queue is how we assign the group the agents that will be calling on behalf of this campaign.
